# Food Delivery API

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/--3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=ffffff)](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

A RESTful API backend service for an online food delivery platform.

The API can create user accounts (includes an initial amount), browse restaurants, view menu items, place orders, and handle order fulfillment.

This solution uses `Node.js` runtime, `Express` for the API layer, `Redis` for user sessions, `Postgres` for relational data.

You can explore the [Live REST API](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evanigwilo/food-delivery-api/tree/main/docs/api-definition.yml)

## Demo accounts

```javascript
identity: mark;
password: 123456;

identity: john;
password: 123456;
```

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (Supporting compose file version 3)
- A [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) compatible shell

### Run The Project

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone this repository** locally;

```bash
# Change to the desired directory
$ cd <desired-directory>

# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/evanigwilo/food-delivery-api.git

# Change to the project directory
$ cd food-delivery-api
```

2. Change environmental variables filename from `.env.example` to `.env`

3. Update the `.env` file configuration values `(optional)`

4. At the root directory, run the following command:

```bash
# Create external docker volume for the postgres database
$ docker volume create postgres-db-volume

# Build and run the server in a container environment
$ docker-compose --env-file .env -p food-deliver-stack -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

5. The api-server will be running at http://localhost:4000/v1

## Useful commands

```bash
# Stops and removes containers, networks and volumes
$ docker-compose --env-file .env -p food-deliver-stack -f docker-compose.yml down -v --remove-orphans
```
